First released in 2014, **JLex BLock** is a popular security extension for Joomla, it works with most of the components available on JED.
Compatible with all Joomla Page builders (SP Page Builder, Yootheme Pro...), Offline Password protection.

If you are looking for a way to protect your articles, products, download pages, or more broadly your entire website... this application will help you. Not only that, it can also protect part of the page (elements) - only it can.

Currently, JLex Block provides the following protection tools:
- Password: This is the most popular method on Joomla. You can set passwords for any pages or elements that you want to protect. In addition, you can customize and add a new theme (template) in your own way. On the same page, you can protect many elements at once.
- Country manager: Deny / Allow requirements from these countries. Each client has one IP, JLex Block will detect the client's country based on IP. Now, JLex Block provides more than 100 countries. So, it will reduce the amount of spam.
- User Group: This method will collect all groups of the Joomla site (like: Public/Guest/Manager/Administrator/Register... and you can add or modify group), and it denies or allows requirements from users of these groups.
- User manager: Same as above, this method will deny or allow requirements from special users. You can set up multiple elements on the same page and assign these elements to users that you want them to see.
- IP manager: Deny / Allow requirements from these IPs. Same as the country manager method, it will reduce the amount of spam.
- Access view level: The basic Joomla CMS provides 4 view levels: Public / Guest / Register / Special. This method allows you to set a minimum level that members can see. Ex: If you set the level is Register, users of Register and special levels can see the content.
- Stop publishing: This method can replace/hide the content of an element or page indefinitely or for a period of time.
